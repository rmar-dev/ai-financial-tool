# New Python Project Documentation

Welcome to the New Python Project documentation! This project demonstrates modern Python development practices and provides a solid foundation for building Python applications.

## Overview

This project is designed with the following principles:

- **Modern Python**: Uses Python 3.9+ with type hints and modern syntax
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- **Code Quality**: Automated formatting with Black, import sorting with isort, and linting with flake8
- **Type Safety**: Static type checking with mypy
- **Development Workflow**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples
